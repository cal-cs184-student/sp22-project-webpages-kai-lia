	<p1> To rasterize triangles, given the 3 vertices of the triangle A, B, and C, we used the point-in triangle test. </p1>
	<ol>
		<img src="./images/q1_bounding.jpg" width="300">
		<li>When we rasterize our triangle in rasterize_triangle, to avoid having to iterate over the whole image every time we rendered a triangle.
			We create a “bounding box” by computing the maximum and minimum values of our x and y values in A, B, and C.
			Thus, creating a ymax, xmax, ymin, and xmin. These max and min coordinates create a box that will contain all possible values of the triangle.
			We can iterate through the said box to get a shorter runtime.</li>
		<img src="./images/p1_baselines.jpg" width="300">
		<li>We derived the equation for 3 lines - a line going from point A to B, a line going
			from B to C, and a line going from C to A.</li>

		</br>
		<li>From there, we performed the line equation test for a given range of x and y coordinates.
			To make sure that rasterizing the triangle would work regardless of the winding order of the points provided, we filled the pixel as long as the
			point (x_i, y_i) satisfied the line equations of A to B, B to C, and C to A or the line equations of A to C, C to B, and B to A.</li>

		<li>If sampling at the center of a given (x_i, y_i) pixel returned a number greater than or equal to 0 for all 3 line equations, it meant
			the point was inside the triangle, and we would fill that pixel.</li>

		<li>Barycentric coordinates are used to express any point in a triangle using 3 scalars - &alpha;, &beta;, &gamma;.If we label the 3 vertices on the triangle P1(x1, y1), P2(x2, y2), and P3(x3, y3), then any point inside of this triangle can be expressed using the vertices of the triangle and barycentric coordinates.
		</li>
		<img src="./images/bc_eqn.png" width="300">
		<li>The equations to calculate the 3 scalars are: above. Where x and y are the coordinates of the point we are checking. If &alpha; + &beta; + &gamma; = 1, 0 <= &alpha; <= 1, 0 <= &beta; <= 1, and 0 <= &gamma; <= 1, then the point x and y is in the triangle (for example (x_i, y_i). Otherwise if the conditions aren’t met (for example the barycentric coordinates of (x_j, y_j), the point is not in the triangle. Since (x_i, y_i) is in the triangle, we can use its corresponding barycentric coordinates and the vertices of the triangle to express itself: x_i = (&alpha;_i * x1) + (&beta;_i * x2) + (&gamma;_i * x3) and y_i = (&alpha;_i * y1) + (&beta;_i * y2) + (&gamma;_i * y3). This is useful when points on a triangle are associated with additional information such as color.</li>

		<img src="./images/color_triangle.png" width="300">
		<li>In the example above, each of the vertices of the triangle are each associated with a color. P1 is a red vertex with a color v_1 = rgb value of (1, 0, 0). P2 is a blue vertex with a color v_2 = rgb value of (0, 0, 1). P3 is a green vertex with a color v_3 = rgb value of (0, 1, 0). Since (x_k, y_k) is a point inside the triangle, we can get that point’s color v_k using its barycentric coordinates where v_k = (&alpha;_k * v_1) + (&beta;_k * v_2) + (&gamma;_k * v_3). That mean’s point k has a rgb value of ((&alpha;_k * r_0) + (&beta;_k * r_1) + (𝝲_k * r_2), (&alpha;_k * b_0) + (&beta;_k * b_1) + (&gamma;_k * b_2), (&alpha;_k * g_0) + (&beta;_k * g_1) + (&gamma;_k * g_2)).

	<h2>Task 5</h2>
	<ol>
		<img src="./images/triangle_ex.png" width="300">
		<li>Pixel sampling is taking pixel values from an existing image (input) and mapping it to an
			output to create a new image. We used pixel sampling to perform texture mapping. We were given a
			triangle in screen space - with vertices (x0, y0), (x1, y1), (x2, y2)- and a triangle in texture space - with
			vertices (u0, v0), (u1, v1), (u2, v2).</li>
		<img src="./images/q2_line_dimension.jpg" width="300">
		<li>We iterated through a range of x and y coordinates, and used barycentric interpolation like in task 4
			to determine if the specific point (x_i, y_i) was in the triangle in screen space. If it was, then we
			used the scalars 𝝰_i, 𝝱_i, 𝝲_i to sample the corresponding point in texture space. We derived the corresponding
			u,v coordinates by using u_i = (𝝰_i * u1) + (𝝱_i * u2) + (𝝲_i * u3) and v_i = (𝝰_i * v1) + (𝝱_i * v2) + (𝝲_i * v3).</li>

		<img src="./images/q2_rendpro.jpg" width="300">
		<li>Depending on the specified pixel sampling method, we either used the nearest sampling method or bilinear
			sampling method to get the color c of the texel (u_i, v_i) and filled the pixel (x_i, y_i) with color c in screen space. </li>
		<li>Using the existing image in texture space, we created a new, corresponding image in screen space. When using
			the nearest sampling method, we returned the color of the texel (u_i, v_i) was closest to. When using the
			bilinear sampling method, we found the 4 texels that (u_i, v_i) was closest to and applied linear interpolation
			to get the final texel (u_f, v_f) and returned it’s color value.</li>

	<p1> example where bilinear sampling clearly defeats nearest sampling</p1>

		<img src="./images/nearest16.png" style="float: left; width: 32%; margin-right: 1%; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
		<li>At 1 sample per pixel, the bilinear sampling tends to be a little more blurred while the nearest sampling
			tends to be a little more jagged. At the 16 sample per pixel, the differences between the bilinear and nearest
			sampling methods is not as obvious, but in test1.svg, both sampling methods at the 16 sample per pixel have a
			more detailed image than the 1 sample per pixel. At the 16 sample per pixel, both sampling methods don’t have
			the gaps in the white line markings on the maps.</li>
		<li>There will be a big difference between the 2 sampling methods when the image being sampled requires a more
			smooth and continuous transition. The nearest sampling method will result in a more rigid and jagged outline,
			while the bilinear sampling method will have a more blurred result because it is taking the weighted average
			of the 4 nearest points.</li>

	<h2>Task 6</h2>
	<p1> </p1>
	<ol>
		<li> Level sampling is similar to pixel sampling where we get the pixel values from an existing image and map it to an output to create a new image except we can also sample these pixel values at different levels or different image resolutions. If we choose to sample at a lower level, we would take the existing textured image and down sample it. Depending on the level we want to sample from, we will recursively downsample and store the image at successively lower resolutions. When implementing level sampling, we had 3 different options to choose from: L_ZERO, L_NEAREST, L_LINEAR. When the level sample method is toggled at L_ZERO, we are sampling at level 0 which is just sampling at the original image resolution. When L_NEAREST is toggled, we calculated the nearest level to be sampled at and got that corresponding level’s image from the mipmap variable. Then, we continued to sample as usual just at a lower resolution image. When L_LINEAR was toggled, we first found the nearest level to be sampled at. If level was a whole number, we just returned the color of the texel being sampled. if it wasn’t a whole number, we found the color of the texel at ceiling of level and floor of level and returned the weighted average of the two colors.</li>
		<li>lsm == L_ZERO: We are sampling at level 0, which is like sampling the image at the original resolution.</li>
		<li>lsm == L_NEAREST: We are downsampling the image recursively and we access the downsampled image by getting the mipmap of the level we are sampling from. From there, we can sample using the nearest or bilinear interpolation method depending on which one is toggled.</li>
		<li>lsm == L_LINEAR: since we want to have the mipmap be continuous we calculated the level, ceiling level, and floor level. If all of them are equal we return the levels color values because calculating a weighted sum would result in 0’s, an all black screen. </li>
		<li>L_LINEAR is the best for antialiasing power. For example, if we had a picture with an image that requires more detail (closer up) and another image that requires less detail (further back), sampling at level 0 will result in aliasing of the image that requires less detail; sampling at level 0 results in too high of a resolution for an image that doesn’t require much detail. However, if we sample at a higher level, the image that requires less detail will be good but the image that requires more detail will have aliasing because it is now being sampled from a lower resolution image. Since L_LINEAR is sampling at different levels and taking the weighted sum, it has more antialiasing power. L_ZERO is the best for memory usage because it is sampling from the original image. L_NEAREST and L_LINEAR sample at different levels meaning the texture image of different levels all need to be saved somewhere. L_NEAREST is the best for speed because it is sampling from lower resolution images. L_ZERO is sampling from the original resolution image, while L_LINEAR involves sampling at 2 different levels.
